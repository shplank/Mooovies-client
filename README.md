Mooovies-client is the front end for the Mooovies application, an app that allows users to browse and search for films, get information about film genres and directors, and create a personal profile in which they can customize a list of favorite films.

The app is built using React and Redux, styled using React-Bootstrap, and bundled using Parcel. The back end of the app is a database created with MongoDB and an API hosted on Heroku. The client interacts with the database via Axios, and displays various views in the form of child components via React-Router.
